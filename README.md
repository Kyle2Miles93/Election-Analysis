# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview 

  I reviewed election results for a Colorado congressional election using Python programming.
I used **Python: Version 3.7.6** to automate the analysis of the election. In my script, I calculated:

1. The total number of votes cast
2. The vote count for each candidate
3. The percentage of votes each candidate received.
4. The winner of the election
  - the winner's vote total and percentage of the vote
  
5. I then wrote a script that automated writing to a text file the results of the election

## Resources

- Software: Python 3.7.6
